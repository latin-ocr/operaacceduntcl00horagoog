ODE 11.

Caius Crispus Sallust, to whom this ode is addressed, was the
son of tbe sister of the distinguished muriae of the same name.
He was a gentleman of equestrian rank and splendid fortune. He
stood high at court, being a particular favorite of Augustus. But

neither his rank nor his fortune.

The poet intends to compliment him on the liberal and noble
use be made of his fortune and his opportunity of diffusing happi-
ness 3 and shows that a proper use of riches is tbe only way to
make thern a blessing. .
