ODlil V.

Murcus Vipsanius Agrippa wes o distinguished general, end so
much estecmed by Augustus, that he geve him his daughter J ulie
in mcrriuge. Agrippa wished his schievements to be celebrated
by Horace, who, while he excuses himself from the more leborioue
und responsible tesh of writing e formul poem, ingeniously peys
him the most flettering compliment He intimctes that Agrippo’s

meruel glory deserves the strsins ose lostier genius then his owny

thnt his was the lyiic muse, end fit only sor hght or tiifling sub-
jects3 but thet Verius, gisted with the subhmest inspiratione os the
epic muse, would sing his prpises in strcins worthy of the subject.

Most commentatore heve thought this ode merely cn excuse οι
Horace for not doing thet which he hed no disposition to do. But
the lhlness os the preises bestowed rendere this conjecture super·
fluous. It is probably only eu instance, among many, ofhis unsui-
ly perscruting whst he pretends to decline doing.
