ODE ΙΙ.

Horace addresses this oda to the Musa Melpomene, as the pa·
troness of lyric poetry. He thanlrs the Muses for their favors to
him even from the hour os his birth, aud seems to imply that he
received in the first momenta of life whatever distinguished him

afterwards. The ode is written with so much beauty and feeling,
that Scaliger says he would rather be the author of it, than be thc
king os Arragon,
