‚ODE XXII.

ΜΓ. Sanadon says, that Horace was at an entertainment where
e disputa began to inflame scine of the company already heated
with wine. Instead of attempting to restore peace by graue ad-
vice and soher reasoning, he gayly proposed to drown all disputes
in a humper3 which heving succeeded, he wrote a few lines on
the occasion.

5. Vana ct lucernis . . . discrepat.- ‘how strangely‘ abhorrent is
the Persian sword from wine and candles :’ i. e. the festive board;
for the Romans usually had their entertainments· by canole-light.

8. Cubita . . . praeeo :r this alludes to dre custom of reclining at
table with the left elbow resting on a conch. ἴ

ODE XXIII.

The occasion of this ode is not known '; although ithae been the
subject ofvarious conjectures. Itis a dialogus, represented ae
having tehen place between a mariner eud the shade of Archytas,
a celebrated mathematician and philosopher os Tarentum.

Archytas had been shipwrecked on the coast of ‘ripulia3 and
the poet represents a mariner, who had accidentally found his
body dn'ven ashore hythe waves, as thus exclaimingr ‘And could
not you escape death, Archytas! How small e space you cover,
who could measure the heavens, the earth, andthe real’ The ad-
dress ofthe mariner occupies the first six versem aad the reply
continues through the ode. ’

others think the meaning to be this: ‘the trifling favor of o little

ding to the prevailing belief that the soul could not pass the Styx
under a hundred years, if the body were not huried. 'l'o diis, ref-
erence is made at the conclusion cf the ode, where themariner is
entreuted to render this little service, of throwing earth upon the
body, which was of so much consequence to the soul.
