EPISTLE ΙΙ. “

Julius Florus, to whom this epistle is addressed, was, at the
time it was written, absent with Tiberius Nero. Horace gives
his reasons for not having complied with the request of Florus
that he would send him some lyric poema. He tells him that he
wished to devote himself to tlie study of philosophy. And ‚
throughout the epistle he intersperses many excellent precepta
forthe regulation of the conduct, and for securing a, good and
happy life. He commences withelively and amusing account
