The Romans believed that many of their gods passed their sum-

of February, and to return to Arcadia on the 5ru of December.
Both these days were obrerved by sacrifices and festivity in bon-
or of Faunus, who was supposed to preside over their flocha and
fields. This ode was probably written for one of his festivals.
In the first part, the poet entreats Faunus, if he pays him due hon-
ors‚ tn amile upon his fields, and preserve the tender offspring of
his floclrs3 and in the second he sets forth the joy of the village
cn the return of his autumnal feast, when man and beust will re·
lux from their mil, and rejuioe in the bounty of their· benefactor.

of his frIends had met together in honor of the occasion3 and that
among them were Horace, and another poet named Telephus, who
was a grem scholar, and who undertook to entertain the company
with some grave discussion on ancient history. Horace interrupta
