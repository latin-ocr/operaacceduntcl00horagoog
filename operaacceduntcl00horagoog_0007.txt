the little pride of e vein end mean conceulment, which, et once,
teke hold on our confidence. We ceu believe the account which
he gives of his own chmmter, without scruple or suspicion. Thu
he wue fond of pleusure is confessed3 but, general] speaking, be

Horace, of ull the writers of antiquity, most nbounds with thet
practicol good sense, und familior observetiou of life und munnere,
which render en author, in e more· emphatic sense, the render’s

their tone of sound understunding, added to their easy, conversation·
