EPODll XI.

'l'he civil war between Caesar and Pompcy had been aucoeeded
by that between Octavius and Brutus3 and when these commo-
tione had come to an end, othere arose between Octavius, then
called Augustus, and Antony. The Roman empiro was divided
between these chiefs, and the Adriatic was covered with their
fleets. A battle was expected, which was to decide the fate oi
the empire. On the eve of thie dreadful scene, Horace composed
this epode‚ in which he deplores the condition of the Roman peo·
ple, aad intimatas that they may as well abendon their country
for ever, as live emidst auch scenas of horror and uncertainty. In
short, the civil ware, witich began between Marius and Sylla rn

the year 666 os Rome, were never perfectly extinguiebed till the
death ol Antony in 724.
